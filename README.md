# NostalgiaLogger

In the old days, you could *tell* when your build was going, because your hard disk drive made sounds when it was working hard. This feedback is lost today, but we can bring it back with NostalgiaLogger.

Build this repo and pass the output to MSBuild as a logger, for example with

```shell
msbuild -l:S:\NostalgiaLogger\NostalgiaLogger\bin\Debug\net472\NostalgiaLogger.dll
```
